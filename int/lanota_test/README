  This is a unit test programme for LAN OTA interfaces.

  Unit test run introduction:
    In rel directory
      make
    In int/lanota_test directory
      make
      make install
    In rel/build/native/test directory
      ./lanota_test

  There is a default RSA-2048 bit private/public key pair 
in files/rsa_private_key.pem and files/rsa_public_key.pem
  And you can generate the RSA-2048 bit private/public key
pair by yourself, and replace content of key pair file.
  To generate a key pair:
    openssl genrsa -out <RSA-2048_private_key> 2048
  To get the public key to stdout for testing
    openssl rsa -in ~/dsn/lanota-privkey -RSAPublicKey_out

  These is a small original image files/org_small_image and 
a large original image files/org_large_image to test LAN OTA,
file content of these files can be modified arbitrarily to do 
test.

  Main loop of unit test can be modified to test one case, 
take TEST_IMG_LARGE_IMG for example,
      for (test_type = 0; 
        test_type < TEST_IMG_TYPE_MAX; test_type++) {
  ==> for (test_type = TEST_IMG_LARGE_IMG; 
        test_type <= TEST_IMG_LARGE_IMG; test_type++) {
  After modification, re-run unit test, then the final 
encrypted LAN OTA image for TEST_IMG_LARGE_IMG can be got 
in rel/build/native/test/files/lanota_image_header_payload.
