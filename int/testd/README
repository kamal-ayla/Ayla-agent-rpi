Makefile targets -

Primary Steps -
1. Copy testd dir to rel/app/
2. Go to rel dir, execute make APP=testd; make APP=testd install.
3. Go to rel/build/native/bin dir; execute devd.
4. Go to rel/build/native/bin dir; execute appd.

Note: If run devd/appd in /home/pi/ayla/bin on PI, please copy ext/* files to /home/pi/ayla/etc/files.


Props API Tests Steps -
1. Execute devd.
2. Execute appd.
3. Let appd run the test code till it runs out of any tests to execute.

  The following steps can be performed manually or performed by python script
automatically in dir py/linux/testdauto of repo module_automation.

4. Execute file_down test from the developer site by setting the
   file_down property.
5. Execute file_up test first time by setting file_up_test property to 1 on
   the developer site.
6. Results till step 5 are saved in Ayla_device_client-eng* file in etc/files.
7. Execute explicit_acks test by first setting Blue_LED to a value and then
   doing the same for Green_LED. Check the status codes for the datapoints
   on the dev site to verify the behavior.
8.  Execute file_down test from the developer site by setting the 
   file_down property the second time, to test recovery.
9.  Execute explicit_acks test for Green_LED the second time, to test recovery
10. Execute file_up test second time by setting file_up_test property to 1
   on the developer site, to test recovery.
11. Execute callback tests by setting input property to 900. This has to be
	done fourth times to run all test cases.
    After the first attempt make sure that devd reconnects to ADS.
12. Execute batch_hold test, set batch_hold to 1, then set cmd property
   to ‘cmdrecovery’, set batch_hold back to 0.
13. Execute batch_hold test, set batch_hold to 1 the second time
   to test recovery.
14. Execute file_up test third time by setting file_up_test property to 1
   on the developer site to test max file queue
15. Execute file_up test fourth time by setting file_up_test property to 1
   on the developer site to get test result in file_up property’s datapoint.
16. Get test result from file_up property's latest datapoint.
